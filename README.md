# My Personal Project

## Closet Picker

The ___Closet Picker___ should be able to ask the user what temperature, time of day, and occasion of the day and choose 
outfit options for that day. The user can also add/remove items from their closet.  


## User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to remove an item of clothing from my closet
- As a user, I want to be able to add an item of clothing to my closet 
- As a user, I want to be able to load an old closet
- As a user, I want to be able to name my closet
- As a user, I want to be able to save a closet I create
- As a user, I want to be able to view the clothes in my closet
- As a user, I want a randomized outfit based on the weather, temperature and occasion of the day

## Future Goals
- I would make individual classes for each of the fields of clothing to allow an increase in functionality
- A lot of the classes right now are interdependent and coupling is loose, so I would work on changing my 
preconditions and post conditions of inter dependent methods in order to increase cohesion and tighten coupling.
