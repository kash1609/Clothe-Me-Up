# My Personal Project

## Closet Picker

**1. What will the application do?**  
The ___Closet Picker___ should be able to ask the user what temperature, time of day, and occasion of the day and choose 
outfit options for that day. The user can also add/remove items from their closet.  
**2. Who will use it?**  
I plan to use it for myself and a couple of my friends were interested as well.  
**3. Why is this project of interest to you?**    
Everyday when I wake up for school, I spend a lot of time not knowing what to wear and whether it will be appropriate 
according to the weather outside. Additionally, the closet picker will include color schemes for the outfit 
and I'm hoping they make my fashion choices better.

##Phase 4: Task 3

- I would make individual classes for each of the fields of clothing to allow an increase in functionality
- A lot of the classes right now are interdependent and coupling is loose, so I would work on changing my 
preconditions and post conditions of inter dependent methods in order to increase cohesion and tighten coupling.
